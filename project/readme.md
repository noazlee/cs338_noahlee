# Topic: Keylogging with a USB
## Members: John Win, Jeremy Gautama, Noah Lee

Description: Physical connections such as USB devices and cables are known to introduce malware to a host system. One type of malware are keyloggers. How can a malicious actor steal sensitive information in a work setting using keylogging and a USB device? We propose a proof-of-concept program, a technical presentation, and a video skit to demonstrate how this might play out in real life. 

Goal: Provide a comprehensive technical, legal, ethical, and social perspectives: the culmination of the different topics we've learnt in this course, of such an attack in a real-world scenario.

Format: Video (approximately 25 mins)
Deliverables: 
1) a skit on how an attack like this might play out in real life, 
2) a technical presentation about the keylogging malware, potential prevention techniques, and legal implications for the attacker, and 
3) the malicious code targeted against WindowsOS.

Guiding questions:
•⁠  ⁠How to get access to a Windows device from a USB?
•⁠  ⁠How to keylog/ execute malicious code on a Windows device?
•⁠  ⁠How to create a txt file, that is not visible from GUI, which will contain all the key-logged data?
•⁠  ⁠How can someone prevent such an attack?
•⁠  ⁠What are the legal implications for the attacker?
