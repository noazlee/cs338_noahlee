What happens when I click a link in a browser?

1. My browser gets the IP address associated with the link.
2. My browser then sends a TCP request for handshake
3. The link's server then authenticates the TCP request and sends an acknowledgement.
4. My browser then acknowledges the connection.
5. **** Encryption probably happens here (keys are sent) with TLS. BIG HANDSHAKE!!
6. Sends a tcp packet containing:
    GET /something/document.txt HTTP/2.0
    Host: example.com
    User-Agent:
7. Server looks for resource, if it finds it or can construct it, server sends document back:
    200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.8.2
    Date:
    Content-Length:

    [Contents of document.txt]
8. Browser ACK for latest packets.
9. Server sends a FIN unless client sends KEEP ALIVE.
10. Browser shoes the contents of document.txt on screen. [If HTML file, browser would parse for tags and then initiate new GET requests for the documents]


TCP Connection has unique ID 4-tuple
    (client IP, client port, server IP, server port)
