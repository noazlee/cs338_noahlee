# Ethics - Noah Lee - October 15th 2024

## Questions:
* Identify the main ethical question or questions faced by the main character ("you") in the scenario. This will certainly include "what should you do?", but there may be other interesting questions to consider.
* For each stakeholder (or category of stakeholders) in the scenario, identify the stakeholder's relevant rights.
* List any information missing from the scenario that you would like to have to help you make better choices.
* Describe your possible actions, and discuss the likely consequences of those actions.
* Discuss whether the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct offers any relevant guidance.
* Describe and justify your recommended action, as well as your answers to any other questions you presented in part A.


### Scenario 2 - Beerz

#### Final Writeup:

In considering the scenario you find yourself in, we find ourselves with the central ethical question of whether you, as an employee, should support the storage of Beerz users' locations, both for future users and retrocatively, from logs. This includes whether or not you should voice your concerns about user privacy (and who to voice them to) and to advocate for this course of action that respects the company's initial commitment to privacy. Given that it was your idea in the first place to implement these features, you need to consider whether your suggested features are wanted by Beerz users in the first place and whether or not there are alternate ways to achieve the goals of improving user experience without violating user privacy. You should also consider whether or not it is ethical for Beerz to go back on their original promises to the users on privacy and how that may impact the company's reputation and profit margin in the future. You should also consider whether it is your responsibility to say anything in the first place, as you are not the boss and it is your job to do the work you are asked to do.

We must look at the rights and responsibilities of the stakeholders involved in order to set the stage of what we should do. You, as an employee, have the right to work in an ethical environment and to voice concerns you have without fear of retaliation from your superiors . You have a ethical responsibility to work on projects which are ethical and to protect the privacy of Beerz users (ACM - protect privacy). Your CEO has the right to try to maximize Beerz profits but the responsibility to do so in an ethical manner as to not do harm to society - specifically Beerz users (ACM - do no harm). Your CTO has the right to raise concerns on ethical decision making and the responsibility to stand up for the technical team to the CEO on issues the CEO is uneducated in - such as in this one. Beerz customers have the right to privacy, anonimity, access to Beerz, and the right to have a good user experience on the app. We see that we have a delicate balence that is also central in our question - how do we better the user experience of the app while minimizing our violation of our users' privacy?

Before moving forward, we must address some key details missing from this context - knowing these details may give us additional hints on what we could do moving forward - or what we are capable of doing in the first place. First and foremost, why are the addresses still present in the logs when the company promised to the users to delete them? If this was unintentional, it represents a severe lapse on the technical team's side and this should be addressed seriously in the company. If it was intentional, then we should question the ethicality of this company as we are keeping user locations while telling our user-base the opposite. Another thing to question is why is the CTO hesitant to speak up during the meeting? Is the Beerz workplace somewhat oppresive to the point where employees are afraid to go against the CEO of the company? If this is true, then you should really reconsider whether or not this company is worth working for - as it may be unlikely that the CEO is willing to listen to what you or your CTO has to say - and you would continue working on a inethical project. Another thing is whether or not the feature is actually wanted by Beerz current users? From the context, it seems the company is moving forward with this feature without doing any form of market research, so they could be violating user privacy for minimal gains in user experience or profits - this is something worth considering.

Moving forward, there seemes to be a few options.\
A. Do not voice your opinion and implement the feature. This would likely be met with severe pushback from users, as you are essentially backstabbing them with your previous promise of privacy. This could also result in negative publicity for the company, which as a startup could be deadly. You would also be doing a ethical disservice by knowingly contiunuing to work on an unethical project.\
B. Insist to your CTO to scrub the logs of the addresses. Given the company previously promised that they were not tracking peoples information, it is ethical to scrub the logs regardless of what the company chooses to do moving forward. The company should also notify their users if/when they decide to start tracking user data, as to not betray the trust of their users. This may be faced with resistance from the CEO or coworkers.\
C. Suggest to your CTO to continue with the feature but give users to option to opt into the address tracking. This would probably go well with users as they have the decision whether or not to give their addresses to Beerz and the more privacy-concerned individuals have the ability to not have their locations tracked. This also allows the feature to still be implemented - which may be a good compromise between user-experience and ensuring privacy for users. 

Moving forward, my advice would be to go with options B and C. Ask your CTO to scrub the logs, and if he is unable to make the order - perhaps due to the stubborness of the CEO - then you should leave the company - as it is your ethical responsibility to not work on unethical projects that violate the user's privacy - especially when you have promised that you were not keeping this data. Option C is also a good middle ground in this context, as you will get user permission to get the data that will enhance the experience for all. It also, is more likely to get approved given your position in the company, but again if this is not approved and they decide to move forward without giving that choice to their users, many users may be inclined to leave and some may question Beerz's ethicality.


#### Planning:
1) The primary ethical question is whether you, as an employee, should support or oppose the storage of users' locations, both for future users and retroactively, from logs. This includes the decision to voice your concerns about user privacy and to advocate for a course of action that respects the company's initial commitment to privacy.The questions to consider for this POV is: "Do I support this?", "Is this good for the company?", "Is it ethical for us to go back on our original promises for privacy?", "Is it my responsibility to do anything?" and "Is there an alternative way to achieve our goals?"

2) Stakeholders:
You: right to work in an ethical environment and to voice concerns without fear of retaliation. responsibility to work on ethical projects and protect Beerz users' privacy.
CEO: Right to maximise Beerz profits but responsibility to do so in a ethical manner
CTO: Right to raise concerns on ethics of decision making and to stand up for the technical team in the company.
Beerz Customers: right to privacy, right to anonimity, right to use Beerz when they want to, right to know that the information they get from Beerz is true and accurate.
Breweries: right to choose to be a part of the app or not

3) Missing information: 
* Why is the addresses in the logs? Should it not have been scrubbed?
* Is there oppression in the workplace? Why is the CTO afraid to speak up to the CEO?
* Are Beerz customers drawn to the company due to its prior promise of data scrubbing?
* Is this new feature really wanted by Beerz current users? Has any market research been done at all?

4) 
A. Implement the feature without saying voicing your opinion -> customers may feel betrayed, violate peoples' privacy \
B. Suggest to implement the feature as an option to users -> may go over better, however many users may be reluctant to join and may not know what this entails - likely to get approved by CEO and CTO \
C. Suggest to bosses to scrap the feature - remind of previous promise. CEO likely to reject this idea. 

5) ACM gives us an idea of what we should strive such as: respect for privacy, being honest and trustworthy, contributing to society and human well-being, and avoiding harm.

6) Recommend option B
